UIImageView alternative for animations that doesn't need to load all the images in memory at once and provide a callback when animation is done.

## Example Usage

```objc
- (void)funWithAnimations
{
  /*
    Load 48 images in images array for animation.
    load0001.png
    load0002.png
    ...
    load0048.png
  */
  NSUInteger quantity = 48;
  NSMutableArray* images = [@[] mutableCopy];
  for (NSUInteger index=1; index<=quantity; index++) {
    NSString* imageName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"load%04d.png", index];
    UIImage* image = [UIImage imageNamed:imageName];
    [images addObject:image];
  }

  /*
    Create the animation view and use it.
  */
  MCAnimationView* animationView = [[MCAnimationView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero];
  [animationView setAnimation:images];
  [animationView setAnimationDuration:2.0f]; // 2 seconds,

  /*
    Start the animation
  */
  [animationView playAnimationRepeatCount:5 willPlayBlock:^(NSUInteger repetition) {
    // Animation will play
  } didPlayBlock:^(NSUInteger repetition) {
    // Animation done playing
  }];

  /*
    When you're done playing it.
  */
  [animationView stopAnimations];
}
```
